# 🏗️ Ball and Beam Balance System

A self-stabilizing Ball and Beam control system built using Arduino, infrared (IR) sensors, MPU6050, and a servo motor. This project showcases real-time control and sensor fusion techniques to balance a ping pong ball at the center of a beam by dynamically adjusting its tilt.

## 📌 Features

- Balances a ping pong ball at the center of a 50 cm beam.
- Uses **two IR sensors** to detect the ball’s position from both ends of the beam.
- Uses **MPU6050 IMU** to measure beam orientation.
- Implements **Kalman Filter** for sensor fusion and noise reduction.
- **Servo motor** adjusts the tilt of the beam in real time to balance the ball.

## 🧠 Control System Logic

- IR sensors detect the distance of the ball from both ends.
- MPU6050 gives the beam's tilt angle.
- Kalman filter fuses accelerometer and gyroscope data from MPU6050.
- A feedback control loop (Proportional control) calculates the required servo position.
- The system continuously adjusts the servo to maintain the ball at the beam’s midpoint (25 cm).
